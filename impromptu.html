       <p>I'm writing this because I'm suddenly afraid of dying.</p>       
       <p>I can explain where is this coming from, but explaining does not give meaning to the fact that I'm scared at the possibility of something that is going to happen. For sure, it is going to happen. To me and to everyone else. </p>  
       <p>Our shared experience.</p>  
       <p>I have no idea if writing about it makes me feel safer or not. Or why, if I'm truly scared, writing here makes sense.</p>
       <p>Shouldn't I be making amends and sending messages telling people I love them?</p>
