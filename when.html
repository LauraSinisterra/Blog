       <p>Someone I met recently asked me: Â¿Do you live more in the past or in the future?. <br> I said I live in the future, but I'm not sure about that answer.</p>       
       <p>I think a more accurate answer could be that I live in the future that unfolds itself right after we act in the present.</p>  
       <p>A near future, close enough to be imperceptible if you think about it. That near future where the word I'm going to type next is trying to find his way out: here.</p>
